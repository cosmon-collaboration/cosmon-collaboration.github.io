My research focuses on understanding low-energy properties of the constituents of matter (hadrons, nuclei, and nuclear matter) by solving Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) using computational techniques. I am particularly interested in making theoretical connections with experiments searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics (neutrinoless double-beta decay, direct dark matter detection, CP violation), as well as understanding the origins of matter in the Universe (baryogenesis, Big Bang and stellar nucleosynthesis) and phases of matter under extreme conditions, such as within the cores of neutron stars.

I largely use lattice methods, in which space and time are discretized; the theory is then solved numerically using high-performance computing.
