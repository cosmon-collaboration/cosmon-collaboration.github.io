I am a theoretical nuclear and particle physicist. My research aims to study the abundant phenomenon involving hadrons in order to connect experiment to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), through the use of Lattice QCD. This method is very numerically intensive and requires the use of the worldâ€™s fastest supercomputers. My focus has been to investigate the structure of nucleons and nuclei and to determine the interactions between nucleons, and other hadrons, that are responsible for e.g. the synthesis of atomic nuclei.
