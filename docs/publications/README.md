    <summary>Lattice QCD study of $\pi\Sigma$--$\bar{K}N$ scattering and the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance<br>
    [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13471" target="_blank">arXiv:2307.13471</a>]</summary>
    <br>
    A lattice QCD computation of the coupled channel πΣ–KN scattering amplitudes in the Λ(1405) region is detailed. Results are obtained using a single ensemble of gauge field configurations with Nf=2+1 dynamical quark flavors and mπ≈200 MeV and mK≈487 MeV. Hermitian correlation matrices using both single baryon and meson-baryon interpolating operators for a variety of different total momenta and irreducible representations are used. Several parametrizations of the two-channel scattering K-matrix are utilized to obtain the scattering amplitudes from the finite-volume spectrum. The amplitudes, continued to the complex energy plane, exhibit a virtual bound state below the πΣ threshold and a resonance pole just below the KN threshold.

    <summary>The two-pole nature of the $\Lambda(1405)$ from lattice QCD<br>

    This letter presents the first lattice QCD computation of the coupled channel πΣ–KN scattering amplitudes at energies near 1405MeV. These amplitudes contain the resonance Λ(1405) with strangeness S=−1 and isospin, spin, and parity quantum numbers I(JP)=0(1/2−). However, whether there is a single resonance or two nearby resonance poles in this region is controversial theoretically and experimentally. Using single-baryon and meson-baryon operators to extract the finite-volume stationary-state energies to obtain the scattering amplitudes at slightly unphysical quark masses corresponding to mπ≈200 MeV and mK≈487 MeV, this study finds the amplitudes exhibit a virtual bound state below the πΣ threshold in addition to the established resonance pole just below the K¯N threshold. Several parametrizations of the two-channel K-matrix are employed to fit the lattice QCD results, all of which support the two-pole picture suggested by SU(3) chiral symmetry and unitarity.

    <summary>Elastic nucleon-pion scattering at $m_\pi=200$ MeV from lattice QCD<br>

    Elastic nucleon-pion scattering amplitudes are computed using lattice QCD on a single ensemble of gauge field configurations with N_f=2+1 dynamical quark flavors and m_pi=200 MeV. The s-wave scattering lengths with both total isospins I=1/2 and I=3/2 are inferred from the finite-volume spectrum below the inelastic threshold together with the I=3/2 p-wave containing the Δ(1232) resonance. The amplitudes are well-described by the effective range expansion with parameters constrained by fits to the finite-volume energy levels enabling a determination of the I=3/2 scattering length with statistical errors below 5%, while the I=1/2 is somewhat less precise. Systematic errors due to excited states and the influence of higher partial waves are controlled, providing a pathway for future computations down to the physical light quark masses with multiple lattice spacings and physical volumes.

    <summary>Two-nucleon S-wave interactions at the SU(3) flavor-symmetric point with $m_{ud}=m_s^{phys}$: a first lattice QCD calculation with the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside method<br>

    We report on the first application of the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside method for computing multi-particle interactions with lattice QCD to the two-nucleon system. Like the Laplacian Heaviside method, this method allows for the construction of interpolating operators which can be used to construct a positive definite set of two-nucleon correlation functions, unlike nearly all other applications of lattice QCD to two nucleons in the literature. It also allows for a variational analysis in which optimal linear combinations of the interpolating operators are formed that couple predominantly to the eigenstates of the system. Utilizing such methods has become of paramount importance in order to help resolve the discrepancy in the literature on whether two nucleons in either isospin channel form a bound state at pion masses heavier than physical, with the discrepancy persisting even in the SU(3)-flavor symmetric point with all quark masses near the physical strange quark mass. This is the first in a series of papers aimed at resolving this discrepancy. In the present work, we employ the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside method without a hexaquark operator in the basis at a lattice spacing of a=0.086 fm, lattice volume of L=48a=4.1 fm and pion mass m_pi≃714 MeV. With this setup, the observed spectrum of two-nucleon energy levels strongly disfavors the presence of a bound state in either the deuteron or dineutron channel.
